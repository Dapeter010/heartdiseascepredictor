Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection and prevention can be crucial in improving patient outcomes. With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, researchers and healthcare professionals are exploring the use of these technologies to develop accurate and efficient prediction models for heart disease. In this assignment, we will use neural networks, a subfield of machine learning, to develop a heart disease prediction model.

The aim of this work is to develop a predictive model using neural networks. The dataset used in this assignment includes various clinical and demographic features of patients, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram results. By training a neural network on this dataset, we will develop a model that can predict the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease.

The significance of this work lies in the potential to improve patient outcomes by detecting and preventing heart disease early. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and relationships within the data, allowing for more accurate predictions and personalized risk assessments. Additionally, this assignment will provide students with valuable skills in machine learning and data analysis, which are increasingly in demand in the health-care industry.

Overall, the heart disease prediction model developed in this assignment has the potential to be a valuable tool for health-care professionals in identifying patients at risk for heart disease and implementing early interventions.
